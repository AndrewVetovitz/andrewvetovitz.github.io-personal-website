    <!--
        Use this file if you want to break sitemaps into smaller chunks. Sitemaps
        should not include pages blocked in robots.txt or with noindex tag as well
        as other pages with little to no value. Ideally limit to 10,000 URLs each sitemap.
        Generally a good idea to break sitemaps by content type if large site:
        static pages (about, home), category and subcategory pages, and landing pages.

        If your site is smaller than 10,000 URLs, likely best to delete sitemap index
        and just use sitemap.xml

        If your sitemaps are programmatically generated, it's usually better to put them
        in your src/routes folder e.g. sitemap.xml.js, or something similar.
